# Linked List Search #

This is the code for a simple linked list search. It goes through all the nodes and returns the index of the list corresponding to the node of which the sum of the values *VAL1* and *VAL2* are equal to the input given.

Here a bunch of C++ function are implement aswell, such as [puts](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/puts/), [gets](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/gets/), [atoi](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/atoi/?kw=atoi) and [itoa](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/itoa/). 

The core concept in this exercise is the **access of memory addressess**.

- The **example.c** file has a linked list sample.
