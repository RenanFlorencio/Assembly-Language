# Serial Output of Expressions #

This program makes use of the serial peripheral provided by the ALE Simulator to print strings to the output. Furthermore, it makes operations based on one of the following options:

- Write straight to buffer.

- Reverse string.

- Write hex version of a decimal value.

- Compute expression (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division).

The core concepts of this exercise are **string manipulation** and **access to peripherals**.
