# Assembly Programming in RISC-V #

This repo contains most of the code I wrote for my Assembly Programming course at university. All of the code runs on RISC-V archtecture, a rather new arctechture in terms of popularity, but one that has been growing quite a lot throughout the last
years.

Note that the code in this repository was written as a solution to the book |**"An Introduction to Assembly Programming with RISC-V" by Edson Borin** (found at *https://riscv-programming.org/book/riscv-book.html*). Therefore, the code was tested on the
RISC-V ALE simulator (found at *https://riscv-programming.org/ale/*).

## Additional Information

- Each of the folders contains a unique exercise and README file. The numbers in the folders names match the level of complexity of the code, being 9 the most complex and the one that's got the greatest amount of low-level programming concepts being used.

- The code for the final project of the course is in a separate repository called "Driving a car with Assembly Language RISC-V".
